# Objective
    This is called the Eureka challenge, which is about the concept of numbers that have the following pattern:
    135 = 1^1 + 3^2 + 3^5

    And the goal is to collect all numbers that have this pattern and output an array with all of these numbers within a range.

# Example Returns:
    sumDigPow(90, 150) will return [135].

# How I Solved It:
* Using nested for-loops.
* Using the Math.pow() method.
* Using the toString().split("") method.
* Using the push() method.
* If-statements.
