# Objective
    Write a function that takes in an array with nested arrays that consist of numbers, and outputs an array with the largest number of each nested array.

# Example Returns:
    largestOfFour([[1,2,3], [6,2,4], [9,2,3], [2,4,1]]) will return: [3, 6, 9, 4].

# How I Solved It:
* With if-statements.
* Iterating through a for-loop.
* Using the push()-method.
